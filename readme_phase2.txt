Title: Daily File Transfer scripting project - UI

Scenario: 
Your company's users create or edit a collection 
of text files throughout the day. These text files represent 
data about customer orders. 
Use your existing code for Phase 2 and Phase 3 upgrades.

Phase 2:
You recently created a script that will check a 
folder for new or modified files, and then copy those new or 
modified files to another location.

Users are asking for a UI (user interface) to make using the 
script easier and more versatile.

Desired features of the UI:
1. Allow the user to browse to and choose a specific folder that will
contain the files to be checked daily.
2. Allow the user to browse to and choose a specific folder that will
receive the copied files.
3. Allow the user to manually initiate the 'file check' process 
that is performed by the script. 

Additionally:
1. establish a database using SQLITE3 to maintain the date 
of the last file transfer.
2. display the last file transfer date on the UI
3. display the number of files transferred

Phase 3
migrate the code to Python 3.4
